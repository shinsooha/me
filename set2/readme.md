TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
 Week two was confusing and interesting I got to see what coding is kind of like for the first time. I think coding is interesting because I could be working on one code for so long but when I come back to it after a couple of days it feels like im seeing it for the first time. Im still not 100% sure if I did exercise 1 correct due to my vs code having probelms with higlighting and debug signs. I really want to know some more tips and tricks for coding and using python/vs code. Hopeuflly by the end of this term im more confident using this app. Also I want some more time to actually go over the meaning of each exercise because thats what I genuinely find interesting about this course, I think its super cool that these random words and letter is making something.
