TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week I really got to start doing my data project during class. It was confusing but also interesting because the project idea was different to what I have imagined myself. Im nervous to do this project because its literally code but also quite interested because its something different. It would be great though if our class time can be separated into help with exercises and other half as working on data project. As I am still struggling to do my exercises not because there insanely hard but because I want to actually properly understand it.
