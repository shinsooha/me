TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

This week I learned alot of admin things to start using github, visual studio code and just general knowledge of my laptop. It was confusing and hard to get my head wrapped around the whole concept, along with setting up my account and connecting it with github. I think the biggest mind blank moment was when python extension suddenly dissappeared and I had to figure out how to re download and re connect everything again. This programming procedure definintely seems like it would get more confusing and I would need much more practice to get better at this procedure. Im hoping that Ben can help me with my mistakes because I feel like something is wrong and I messed something up in the middle.
